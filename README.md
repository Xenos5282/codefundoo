After a natural disaster occurs, people are often seperated from their families. Some might be able to tell their whereabouts or relatives' information but most of them are incapable to do so. So to overcome this problem, I am planning to build an app which somewhat helps towards this cause. As it is evident, we are living in the smartphone-age. Most of the smartphones come with a fingerprint scanner. Also most people have their bio-metrics registered now-a-days under Aadhaar be it poor or rich due to various government schemes. So in the aftermath of a disaster, people whose family members are missing can upload their Aadhaar number on the app, without any name, without any details, just the Aadhaar number. People who engage in rescue operations mostly would have smartphones with them. All they would need to do is scan the fingerprints of the people who dont have clue of their whereabouts or kin. So, fingerprint would be matched with the Aadhaar database, and the only thing that I will be accessing would be Aadhaar number(to keep up with the privacy issues). The location of scanning would be geo-tagged and if the Aadhaar number of the person found matches any Aadhaar number reported in the lost category, that user will be notified with that person's last location. This can make the current which deals with the problems of missing persons definitely a whole lot faster and convinient.
